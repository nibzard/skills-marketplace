# Idea to Illustration Mapping

*For the full conceptual foundation, see `visual-world.md`.*

## The Goal

Every illustration should feel **connected** to the content—
not as literal depiction, but as a visual that resonates with the idea.

More importantly, every illustration should feel like it belongs to the same world:
**“A day in the life of a builder”**—the working life of someone who builds software with AI.

The feeling we’re after:
**calm, aspirational, warm, intelligent, inviting.**
The viewer should think: *“That’s my world. That’s how I work.”*

## Connection Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Direct | Content is about X, show X | Article about notebooks → show a notebook |
| Metaphorical | Content is about a concept, show a symbol | Iteration → woodworking plane |
| Atmospheric | Content is about a state, show an environment | Deep work → late-night desk with lamp |
| Emotional | Content is about a feeling, show an expression | Frustration → crumpled paper |

## Subject Matter Categories

### 1. The Builder’s World
Literal objects from daily life. Creates warm, recognizable “day in the life” feeling.

**Objects:** laptop, monitor, keyboard, notebook, pen, mug, headphones, desk lamp, bookshelf, plant, guitar, window, chair

**Recurring elements** (use naturally; occasional presence builds recognition):
- **The Mug** — a simple ceramic mug in a brand color. Well-worn, clearly a favorite.
- **The Notebook** — Moleskine-style, slightly worn. Represents analog thinking alongside digital building.
- **The Headphones** — professional over-ear, noise-cancelling. Signals focus and craft.
- **The Guitar** — acoustic guitar in home studio scenes. Signals creative depth and cultivated skill.
- **The Dog** — black lab. Emotional anchor. Represents life around the work—companionship, breaks, permission to be human.
  Use in **scenes**, not icons.

**Rituals:** coffee being poured, headphones going on, notebook opening, morning light

### 2. Metaphors & Mental Models
Symbolic representations of concepts.

| Concept | Objects |
|--------|---------|
| Craft / refinement | woodworking plane, sandpaper, chisel |
| Direction / strategy | compass, map, path |
| Growth | plant, seedling, tree rings |
| Building / systems | blocks, gears, blueprints |
| Focus | tunnel, spotlight, single object on empty desk |
| Iteration | eraser shavings, crossed-out text, layers |
| Completion | checkbox, finish line, closed laptop |

### 3. Digital Artifacts
Hand-drawn representations of digital things. Bridge warmth with technical content.

**Elements:** terminal window, code snippet, chat bubbles, UI wireframe, folder tree, browser window,
cursor, buttons, form fields

## Quick Reference: Objects by Meaning

### Beginnings & Planning
Blank notebook, empty mug, dawn light, calendar, pen uncapped, clean desk

### Active Work & Building
Hands on keyboard, terminal output, multiple tabs, coffee mid-cup, headphones on

### Iteration & Refinement
Sandpaper, woodworking plane, eraser shavings, crossed-out text, layers

### Completion & Shipping
Closed laptop, checkbox marked, finish line, raised mug, sunset light

### Struggle & Friction
Crumpled paper, tangled cables, error message, head in hands

### Focus & Depth
Headphones, closed door, lamp in darkness, single object on empty desk

## Decision Process (for concepting)

1. **Identify core idea** — what is the ONE thing this content is really about? (The insight, not the topic.)
2. **Consider visual context** — what other illustrations or visual elements exist nearby? Avoid duplicating themes.
3. **Choose category** — Builder’s World, Metaphor, or Digital Artifact?
4. **Select objects** — based on image type:
   - **Icon:** 1 object
   - **Scene:** 2–4 objects
   - **Periphery:** 1–3 objects (more than icon, less than full scene)
