# Illustration Style Guide (Builder Methods)

This document defines how illustrations should *look*—independent of subject matter.

## Primary Look

- **Hand-drawn ink line art** on a warm off-white canvas
- **Confident black lines** with slight hand variance (not perfectly geometric)
- **Minimal shading**: only subtle grounding shadows
- **One accent color** used in blocks/fills (not gradients)

## Composition Principles

- **Restraint wins**: 1 clear focal object, or a small cluster
- **Negative space**: leave room for headlines, especially in hero images
- **Implied environment**: suggest place with 1–3 cues (window edge, desk line, lamp glow), not full rooms
- **Avoid clutter**: no busy backgrounds, no dense textures

## Rendering Rules

### Linework
- Use one primary stroke weight; slight variation is okay
- Prefer organic curves and minor imperfections
- No sketchy “hairball” shading; keep lines clean

### Fill & Accent
- Only one accent color per illustration
- Accent coverage target: ~20–30% of the image
- Accent can fill a mug, notebook cover, UI panel, highlight shape, etc.

### Shadows / Depth
- Shadow coverage target: ~5–10%
- Use the brand shadow color softly to ground objects
- Do not use dramatic lighting or heavy gradients

### Surfaces
- Background is flat warm off-white
- Surfaces may be implied with a single horizon/desk line
- If adding a “panel” or “card”, keep it minimal and on-brand

## Do / Don’t

**Do**
- Keep it warm, calm, aspirational
- Make objects feel well-used and human
- Use everyday builder tools + subtle tech artifacts
- Keep screen content generic (nonsense code)

**Don’t**
- Photorealism, 3D, glossy renders
- Busy scenes with many objects
- Real brand logos or recognizable UI brands
- Excessive gradients, complex textures, neon palettes
