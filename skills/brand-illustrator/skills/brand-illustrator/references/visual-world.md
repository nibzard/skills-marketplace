# Builder Methods – Visual World Definition

A visual world that feels like: **a day in the life of a builder**—someone who builds software with AI.

## Two Tiers of Illustration

### Tier 1: Objects (Primary)
Single objects or small groupings (2–3 items). These are our workhorses—used frequently across:
- social posts
- inline graphics
- accent images
- anywhere we need quick visual punctuation

Objects are drawn in isolation or with minimal context. They should feel like they were lifted from a larger scene,
carrying the warmth and character of our world without needing to show it all.

**Examples:** a worn notebook, a steaming mug, headphones on a desk edge, a terminal window, a dog curled up.

### Tier 2: Scenes (Secondary)
Fuller illustrations showing environment and context. Used for:
- blog headers
- key landing pages
- hero moments

Even scenes should stay restrained: **1–3 focal objects with suggested environment**, leaving space for the viewer’s imagination.

We’re not creating detailed panoramas. A scene might show hands on a keyboard with a window visible behind,
or a coffee shop table with afternoon light—enough to establish place and mood, not everything in the room.

## Subject Matter Categories (the three wells)

The Builder Methods visual world draws from three wells:

1. **The builder’s daily life** — tools, rituals, environment, the dog
2. **Metaphors & mental models** — how the builder thinks about concepts
3. **Digital artifacts** — hand-drawn representations of the work itself

Recurring elements (dog, mug, notebook, headphones, guitar) build familiarity over time but **don’t** appear in every piece.
The constants are the **style** and **feeling**, not specific objects.

## Variables That Create Range

### Environments (for Tier 2 scenes)
- Travel (airplane, hotel)
- Metaphorical spaces (workshop, kitchen, garden)

### Mood levers
- Time of day (morning light, late-night lamp)
- “Focus” (single object on empty desk) vs “build mode” (multiple tabs/terminal)
- Calm vs friction (crumpled paper, tangled cable) – use friction sparingly
