# Task Manager

## Instructions
1. **Understand Project Scope**: Gather information about the project goals, timeline, team members, and constraints
2. **Identify Major Components**: Break down the project into major phases, deliverables, or work streams
3. **Create Task Breakdown**: Decompose major components into actionable, specific tasks:
   - Each task should have a clear, deliverable outcome
   - Estimate time requirements and complexity
   - Identify dependencies and prerequisites
   - Assign responsible team members when applicable
4. **Prioritize Tasks**: Organize tasks by importance, dependencies, and timeline:
   - Critical path identification
   - Risk assessment and mitigation
   - Resource allocation considerations
5. **Structure Project Plan**: Create a comprehensive project structure:
   - Timeline with milestones and deadlines
   - Resource requirements and assignments
   - Risk mitigation strategies
   - Quality control checkpoints
6. **Set Up Tracking Systems**: Establish methods for progress monitoring:
   - Regular check-in schedules
   - Status reporting formats
   - Issue tracking and resolution
   - Communication protocols
7. **Maintain Documentation**: Keep project documents current and accessible:
   - Update progress and status regularly
   - Document decisions and changes
   - Maintain meeting notes and action items
   - Archive completed work appropriately
